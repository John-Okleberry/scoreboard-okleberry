# Scoreboard

## Project Overview 
"Scoreboard" is a counting app meant to emulate a standard scoreboard used in basketball games. Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all demonstrated. Stretch goals were completed and functionality was expanded beyond the original scope of 3 buttons and a display to track points. Functionality such as a countdown timer and persisting period states were added while expanding the project scope.


## Features

__Requirements:__ </br>
- Build it from "scratch"
- Follow the design (taken from a Figma file)
- Make all six buttons work (+1, +2, + 3 for both home and guest)

__Stretch Goals:__ </br>

- Add a "New Game" button
- Highlight the leader
- Add a few more counters (e.g. period, fouls, timer)
- Change the design (make it your own, turn into a counter for a different sport)
</br>
_My Implementation:_ </br>

- Changed the background to a gradient
- Added a countdown clock including
    - Start/Stop
    - "+5" or "-1" minutes (to fine tune timer settings as needed)
- Added a foul tracker for each team
- Added a period tracker for the game (includes "H" for halftime)
